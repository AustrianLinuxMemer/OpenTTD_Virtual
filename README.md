# Where are the final files?

Both lossy compressed versions in M4A, MP3 as well as lossless compressed versions in FLAC with Metadata will be provided in both the "RC" directory and as discrete releases

# What else?

- To ensure that this project stays true to it's goals, it is only allowed to use vanilla OpenTTD content is both the remixes and the album covers. to keep the OpenTTD vibe, i also forbid to use any other OpenMSX render as the renders i provide in this repository. I will include a copy of both the OpenMSX and OpenSFX taken verbatim from the official OpenTTD website plus my personal renders of the OpenMSX tracks (they are done with Windows Media Player and Audacity), these files are to be found in the "Resources" subdirectory.

- The Audacity projects belong in the "Audacity" subdirectory.
- The final audio files that will be released belong in the "RC" subdirectory.

# Where to find the source material?

As mentioned above, my personal renders of the OpenMSX tracks as well as the OpenMSX and OpenSFX packages themselves are to be found in the "Resources" subdirectory
**Please do NOT change anything in the "Resources" directory**
