Name= Remko Bijker (Rubidium)
Message= Hi,

in accordance with http://www.freesound.org/usersViewSingle.php?id=29541 I'd
like to make sure you are the copyright holder of
http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=54965 ("Passenger jet
departs 2.wav").

Furthermore I would like to use a ~3 second snippet from the aircraft's
noise (add fade in and fade out) as aircraft take-off sound for a free sound
sample set for OpenTTD. OpenTTD (www.openttd.org) is a reimplementation of
Transport Tycoon Deluxe (released in 1995) and we would like the game to be
playable without the original sound files. As such we are looking for free
replacement samples.
More information about this replacement set, called OpenSFX, can be found at
http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx . It will/is released under
CC-Sampling Plus with sources, well actually only the 3 seconds from your
sample that are used.
All used sounds are credited with name and creator in the readme
(http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx/repository/entry/docs/readme.tx
t). It would be natural that your sample will be credited. E.g. 
- "digifishmusic" from "freesound.org", produced by "www.digifishmusic.com"
I'm open for other suggestions though, as long as it's relatively within the
current style.

Regards,
Remko Bijker (Rubidium)
